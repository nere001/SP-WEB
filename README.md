# SP-WEB
Hi, are you worried about people seeing things you don't want them to see while streaming (on Discord or elsewhere)? Introducing SP-WEB: a full streamproof web interface.

Instructions:

Alt + Y: Hides the application on your screen.

Button 1: Performs the same action (hides the app).

Button 2: Allows the stream viewers to see the application.
